OVHC insures against potential expenses you may incur if you require medical or hospital treatment. 
    In some cases, it may be a condition of your visa to hold a form of OVHC - for example, if you are working visa 482 or 485 applicant or an overseas student.

    In addition to cover for hospital and medical expenses, you can also purchase General Treatment cover. General Treatment cover pays benefits towards the services of health care providers in private practice such as dentists, optometrists and physiotherapists. Insurance can cover part of these costs, though you would still need to cover part of the fees yourself.
    Lifetime Health Cover and the private health insurance rebate do not apply to overseas visitors\' health cover. Goods and Services Tax (GST) is applied to the cost of overseas visitors\' health cover purchases.

You can also opt to be covered by insurance policies issued in other countries. Remember, if you are on a visa with specific health insurance conditions, you need to purchase the type and level of health insurance specified by your visa.
    The internet is a good way to locate insurance cover for visitors. We suggest you search for "Overseas Visitors Insurance" or "Overseas Visitors Health Cover" in a search engine and compare policies from at least three providers.

Travel insurance may cover you for items that are not covered on visitors\' cover such as loss of travel goods and repatriation in a medical emergency. Travel insurance should be purchased in your country of origin, before you depart for overseas.';
